Run `ruby app.rb` to run it.

- Have not finished implementing transaction limit.
- In app.rb you can see how I use the user_interface_components where needed. Would have liked
to break it up into smaller components.
- I'm not crazy about the structure.
- The more I work on it, the more I just want Rails and AR so I don't have to build stuff myself.
